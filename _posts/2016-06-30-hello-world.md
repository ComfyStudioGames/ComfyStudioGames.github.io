## Hello World!

Hi everyone. Welcome to the Comfy Studio Games development blog for our game **Robots Minerals Profit!** - a side-on builder game with a robotic mining colony theme. We are two friends working on the game full time. 

**Robots Minerals Profit!** is a side-on builder game - what does that mean?

In a typical builder game, you start off with very little - whether it’s villagers and wood or buildings and money - and then use what you start with to grow, and start getting more of whatever it is you need to continue expanding, use the new resources to expand and and to face challenges which threaten your survival. In **Robots Minerals Profit!** you'll do just that - start off with only a few robots and an old, broken base, rebuild the base and get it up and running, then solve the problems your colony will face.

Side-on is the perspective we have chosen for the player’s view of the game world - like ant farms in the real world. It’s an underused angle - SimTower being a popular classic and only more recently Fallout Shelter, as well as recent indie title Sheltered show us that it’s a view people enjoy. It gives weight to the vertical depth of the game world as opposed to the horizontal as with an isometric perspective, and we feel this is very appropriate to a mining colony themed game.

**What does ‘comfy’ mean? **

Comfy just means comforting - this kind of game is pleasant and calming to play. Some games challenge you by testing your reflexes, and forcing you to make difficult decisions under pressure - this is something the comfy type of game avoids. It’s not the kind of game you play competitively while drinking Red Bull - it’s the kind of game you can play wrapped in a blanket with a hot chocolate before going to bed.

**What makes a game comfy?**

Comfy games tend to allow you to set something up and watch it run. They’re comparable to a toy train set - switch it on and watch it go. There’s a unique comfort in watching something you built move by itself.

This isn’t to say that comfy games require no interaction. The interaction in a comfy game is a calm decision-making process. Where should I build my next factory? Do I have the resources to build it yet? You’re watching out for imbalances, trying to ‘keep the plates spinning’ - all the while working out the best way to grow, keep your base going and keep your pawns productive.

The risk with making a game too comfy, however, is that they become too easy to leave running. It actually becomes possible to walk away from your computer for a few hours and to come back with tons of resources to spend. The realisation that you don’t actually have to play a game to succeed makes the game boring. This is why we need monkey wrenches - problems which crop up and need untangling, knocking your plates out of balance - like earthquakes in Theme Hospital, or riots in Prison Architect.

We’ll be continuing to make these blog posts to keep you up-to-date about our progress, and to show you new additions to the game.
